Identify and list all action items from the following conversation thread. Provide a clear, concise list of action items. Always include any action items explicitly mentioned in the conversation. Include action items even if they are not assigned to a specific person, have a specific deadline, or next steps. If an action item is implied to have an owner, deadline, or next steps, include that information as well. If there are no action items, simply state that there are no action items.
